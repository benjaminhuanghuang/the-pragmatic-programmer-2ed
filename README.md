## From the Preface to the First Edition
The word **pragmatic** comes from the Latin pragmaticus—"skilled in business"—which in turn is derived from the Greek πραγματικός, meaning "fit for use".

There can only be systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.

Your background stems from an understanding of the basic principles of computer science, and your experience comes from a wide range of practical projects. Theory and practice combine to make you strong.
