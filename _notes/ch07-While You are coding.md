- Outdated knowledge
- Usage
- Performance
- The tests paass

- Tip 65 Refactor Early, Refactor Often
How?
- Don’t try to refactor and add functionality at the same time.
- Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. 
- Take short, deliberate steps


## Topic 41 Test to Code
- Tip 66 Testing Is Not About Finding Bugs

- Tip 67 A Test Is the First User of Your Code

The basic cycle of TDD is:
- 1. Decide on a small piece of functionality you want to add.
- 2. Write a test that will pass once that functionality is implemented.
- 3. Run all tests. Verify that the only failure is the one you just wrote.
- 4. Write the smallest amount of code needed to get the test to pass, and verify that the tests now run cleanly.
- 5. Refactor your code: see if there is a way to improve on what you just wrote (the test or the function). Make sure the tests still pass when you’re done.
