## Topic 3. Software Entropy
Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of “disorder” in a system.

Entropy means Software rot

all negative thoughts which can spread among team members, creating a vicious spiral(恶性循环)

broken window means: bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code. you can comment out the offending code, or display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.

If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it’s all too easy to slip into the mindset of "sAll the rest of this code is crap, I’ll just follow suit."

**No broken windows. Find out broken window and fix it**

## Topic 4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs 
Act as a catalyst, bringing the resource together so they can jointly produce something that they couldn’t have done by
themselves—a synergistic result

Show your work to people, and let them join and say "of course, it would be better if we added..."

People find it easier to join an ongoing success

Most software disasters start out too small to notice, the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and team

In the Broken Window Theory, people lose the will to fight entropy because they perceive that no one
else cares. The frog just doesn’t notice the change.
